I developed classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree) on telemarketing data, achieving up to 85.69% accuracy. Through feature selection using Lasso regression and Random Forest, I identified key predictors of success. The insights derived were used to enhance marketing strategies and improve campaign outcomes.
